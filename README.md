Bootcamp HW for Machine Learning


## Pre Processing
Before working on the assigned dataset, I read through the explanation of the column headers on the KOI webpage provided. This allowed me to understand more about the possible importance of each variable to my model. 

## Model 1
Based on what I was able to learn from the KOI definitions, I thought a good initial model would take into account the "boolean" variables pertaining to the orbits of the KOI (first 4 columns of the spreadsheet). Using these variables, I was able to obtain a model with an accuracy near 50%, so my understanding of the variables appears to be somewhat reasonable. I will begin adding additional information to try and get better results for my model.
